# Box Plot for Pitcher Statistics
Looking at our data for pitchers over the past four full seasons you notice games with some extreme outliers. The most consistent statistic for pitchers is the amount of time they see per game which is expected in baseball because every game is limited to 9 innings. You can see there was a game that went into the 14th inning which is very rare in the world of baseball. But you can see the complete overall domination by SNHU baseball over the past 4 years with the combination of low walk averages (lower than 1 per game) and very high strikout average (around 8 per game).
